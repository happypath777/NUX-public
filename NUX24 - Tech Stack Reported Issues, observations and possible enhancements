NUX24 - Tech Stack Reported Issues, observations and possible enhancements

1. $NUXMetamask_io - Notifications to mobile device not displayed as expected and does not take the user to the transaction after a NUX tokent has been sent

2. $NUXUNI - Tokens with large names are not rendered in the UNI very well i.e. no wrapping, cutting off or giving '...'

3. $NUXARB - creating a basic token on Sepolia was much easier than ARB testnet- kept getting a remix error then moved effort to Sepolia

4. $NUXalchemy_com - new policy to require 0.001 of the base currency before sending test tokens from the faucets seems to be an unnessary roadblock for development, seems like a better approach would be to encourage a deep understanding of the login account.  Impacts usability however the cost may be worth it from a security perspective.  

5. $NUXUNI - in previous version of UNIswap the user could populate their own list of tokens - it would be helpful to bring back the feature to allow users to easily do this 

6. NUXmetamask_io - Batch import to a wallet would be helpful - i.e. just point to a properly formated github page

7. $NUXUNI - Uniswap analytics for Sepolia would be helpful and userful as new developers explore the chain

8. General - create more full functional production equalvelent dapps (like Uniswap) on Sepolia for exploration and testing
